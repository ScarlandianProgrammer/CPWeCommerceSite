# Data Driven Design Website

This is the repository for a class project for my .NET Web Programming course.
It is a dynamic, data-driven website made with .NET 7.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 7
- Visual Studio (prefered)

## Contributing

If you want to help improve this website, be sure to follow best practices, and try to match the surrounding code,
so that it doesn't look too disjointed.

Only make one pull request per Issue, and make sure that the Issue is linked properly in the pull request.

<strong>DO NOT</strong> merge multiple changes into one pull request, unless they have the same root cause. That way,
I only have to worry about one problem at a time when reviewing code.
